## NOTE: 
Currently the Program.cs is running the game according to the example of a small play that can be found in the assignment documentation using the line board.SmallPlay();.<br>
We've also created a function that runs the game in our intented automated version of the game.<br>
In order to run that uncomment the line board.StartGame();.<br>
